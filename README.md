🐢 Turtle Racing Bet Game

A fun and simple Python project built using Turtle Graphics and basic OOP concepts.
Choose a turtle, place your bet, and watch them race to the finish line!

🎮 How the Game Works

01.When the game starts, you are asked to enter a color to place your bet.
02.Seven turtles line up at different vertical positions.
03.Once the race begins, each turtle moves forward by a random amount every step.
04.The first turtle to cross the finish line wins the race.
05.A message appears on the screen telling you whether you won or lost based on your bet.

🧩 Technologies & Concepts Used

*Python Turtle Graphics for drawing and animation.
*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for creating and managing multiple turtles.
*Random module to simulate unpredictable race movement.
*Basic event handling for text input and screen interaction.

▶️ How to Run the Game

01.Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
02.Run the program using:
    *python main.py
03.The Turtle Graphics window will open automatically.
