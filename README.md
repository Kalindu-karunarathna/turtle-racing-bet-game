## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. When the game starts, you are asked to **enter a color** to place your bet.  
2. Seven turtles line up at different vertical positions.  
3. Once the race begins, each turtle moves forward by a **random amount** every step.  
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line **wins the race**.  
5. A message appears on the screen telling you whether **you won or lost** based on your bet.
